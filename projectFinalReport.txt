Introduction:-
Every project should have a specific set of goals 
and associated benefits.... what are you trying 
to accomplish, and why?
 The right set of goals can ensure that your project 
 suits a true development purpose,
 and it creates a common purpose

Design and implementation:-

1 :- The design and actual realization of our project
  guide is a document that includes
 the design patterns for the future product. 
It also describes all possible UI elements 
and content types used, defining the rules 
of how they should be arranged and work 
with each other.

2 :-  Any project, there will almost always
 be unexpected problems and questions that crop up.
 When these issues arise, you have to be ready to deal 
with them, i have encountered data-toggle, carousel,
or jquery issues when i run the code sometimes my code
didn't work.

3 :- In programming, a library is a collection of precompiled 
routines that a program can use. The routines, 
sometimes called modules, are stored in object format. 
Libraries are particularly useful for storing frequently
used routines because you do not need to explicitly 
link them to every program that uses them.

4 :- include a few screenshots of your websites in the report

Conclusions

1 :- A project is temporary in that it has a defined beginning 
and end in time, and therefore defined
 scope and resources in my bootstrap-4 project we realize that
how to manage or analysis project assignments and deadlines

2 :- In my bootstrap-4 project, then, is the application 
of knowledge, skills, tools, and techniques to project activities 
to meet the project requirements

3 :- i think we create many things to do different in bootstrap-4
project like jquery code.
